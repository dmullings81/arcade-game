# Frogger!

Welcome to my version of the classic arcade game *Frogger* created as a project in Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. This project demonstrates my Object-Oriented JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas skills.

In order to play the game, simply head over [this website](http://dmullings81.github.io/arcade-game/index.html).
##Instructions

###Concept
That's you at the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to cross the road to the river picking up stars as many times as possible, while avoiding the pesky bugs.

###Controls
To move the player, simply use the arrow keys _up_, _down_, _left_ and _right_.

###Scoring Points
To score points, pick up the stars. Each star is worth 1000 points.
Also if you enter any of the river tiles at the top of the screen, you get 500 points and you will then be sent back to safety across the road.

###Difficulty
The higher your score, the faster the bugs will move!

###Lives
You have 3 lives. Each time you hit a bug you use up one of those lives. If you have no remaining lives left and you hit a bug it will be game over.

####How many points can you score?!

##Usage

To run the game simply open the file index.html. If you want to download the game, ensure you download index.html and the js, images, css folders. This version of Frogger is written in JavaScript, so if you are having trouble loading the game, make sure JavaScript enabled in the browser's settings.
It is designed to be controlled using keyboard inputs. Therefore, you'll need a keyboard to control the game. Sorry smartphones and tablets!
