# Frogger! by Dimitris Mullings

Welcome to my version of the classic arcade game *Frogger* created as a project in Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. This project demonstrates my Object-Oriented JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas skills.

In order to play the game, simply head over [this website](https://www.github.com). If the game does not load up, check you have JavaScript enabled in your browser's settings.

##Instructions

###Concept
That's you at the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to cross the road to the river as many times as possible, while avoiding the pesky bugs.

###Controls
To move the player, simply use the arrow keys up, down, left and right.

###Scoring Points
To score points, enter any of the river tiles at the top of the screen. You get one point each time you make it. You will then be sent back across the road.

###Lives
You have 3 lives. Each time you hit a bug you use up one of those lives. If you have no remaining lives left and you hit a bug it will be game over.

####How many points can you score?!
